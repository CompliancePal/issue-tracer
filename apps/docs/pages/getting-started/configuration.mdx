# Repository configurations

The following configurations must be performed in the repository.

## Setting the action

The following action must be added to the repository to enable the traceability.

```yaml filename=".github/workflows/tracer.yml"
name: Issue tracing
on:
  issues:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  tracer:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Issue tracer
        uses: CompliancePal/issue-tracer@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret has repository scope. If you refernce issues in other repostories, you need to provide a `PAT` that has the followig scopes:

- repo

## configure issue templates

The following issue template enables tracing for all issues refined from it.

```markdown filename=".github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/template.md"
---
title: Issue with traceability
---

...

## Traceability <!-- traceability -->

<!-- Traceability content will be added here by tracer action -->

...
```

The template can have any structure. The `tracer` action maintains the traceability information under the section marked with the "heading" with `<!-- traceability -->`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You must add at least one issue template configured for traceability in the
  repository.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Enabling the traceability with issue templates provides a consistent
  experience. With tracing enabled by default for all relevant issues, you avoid
  errors that can occur from manually crafting your issues.
</Callout>

## Configure pull request template

The following template enables tracing the issues that is resolved by the pull request

```markdown filename=".github/pull_request_template.md"
Resolves #{requirementNumber}.

<!-- The rest of the template -->
```

Marking which change request resolves a particular issue is achieved using the GitHub's functionality of [cross references with keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword).

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Pull requests must use a [pull request
  template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)
  to make the experience consistent, and eliminate human error.
